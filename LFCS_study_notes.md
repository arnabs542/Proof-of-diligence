# What I want to achieve?
Be able to navigate and admin the file system, process tree, network in linux system from application's perspective

# Command Line
## history
```
$ cat /proc/loadavg
$ echo $(!cat) # run the last cat command
```
## cp
```bash
$ cp -i /etc/passwd ./passwd # interactive mode
```
## dpkg
```bash
$ dpkg -S $(which ps) 
procps: /bin/ps
$ dpkg -L procps # List files `owned' by package(s).
...
$ dpkg -L procps # Display package status details.
...

```
## uptime
rule of thumb: 
* For a single core values should be less than 1
* For dual core less than 2, etc

uptime commmand reads from:
* /proc/uptime
* /proc/loadavg 
```bash
$ cat /proc/uptime
1628906.51 1623296.05 # uptime in seconds, idle time in seconds
```
## p and k
* pgrep, pkill, killall
* default signal is -15 or -term or -sigterm
* really kill -9 -kill -sigkill
```bash
$ ps -l # long listing, [SZ] is the size in pages
$ getconf PAGESIZE # get the Virtual Memory PAGESIZE
$ getconf PAGE_SIZE # same as above
$ ps -f # full listing
$ ps -ef # all process with full listing
$ sleep 900& # create a process running in the background
$ pgrep sleep # search a process
$ pkill sleep # kill a process matching sleep
$ killall sleep # kill all process matching sleep
```

Examine the process with 'pmap -x <PID>' and see which particular mapping (or mappings) is growing.  Of course if it is the heap, then you'll have to do the debugging at the Java or library level to see why the memory is continuing to leak.

[anon] just means that the memory isn't backed by any particular file (it wasn't paged in from disk), and it's not part of the heap or stack. So it's memory that that has been allocated to the process, not directly in the heap.  I see that most multi-threaded proceses tend to have quite a number of anon mappings. I presume this is some sort of thread-local storage for each. 

## top
* kill
* renice
* sort & display
```bash
$ top -n 2 -d 3 # n sample, d duration
```
in top, you can toggle:
* uptime with 'l'
* task with 't'
* memory with 'm'
* show fields management with 'f', choose the sort field with 's'
* renice with 'r'
* kill with 'k'

## htop
More user friendly than top
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install htop
```
* VIRT stands for the virtual size of a process, which is the sum of memory it is actually using, memory it has mapped into itself (for instance the video cardâ€™s RAM for the X server), files on disk that have been mapped into it (most notably shared libraries), and memory shared with other processes. VIRT represents how much memory the program is able to access at the present moment.

* RES stands for the resident size, which is an accurate representation of how much actual physical memory a process is consuming. (This also corresponds directly to the %MEM column.) This will virtually always be less than the VIRT size, since most programs depend on the C library.

* SHR indicates how much of the VIRT size is actually sharable (memory or libraries). In the case of libraries, it does not necessarily mean that the entire library is resident. For example, if a program only uses a few functions in a library, the whole library is mapped and will be counted in VIRT and SHR, but only the parts of the library file containing the functions being used will actually be loaded in and be counted under RES.
